      <description>Yesterday I gave a virtual talk at JSM 2021 on Visualizing Economic and Financial Market Trends in Volatile Times.
Here is a summary of my remarks.
The COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic slowdown has led to unprecedented volatility in many economic and financial time series. With swings well outside of historical ranges, many forecasting models break down. Data visualization techniques are a powerful tool to help the analyst understand evolving economic and financial market trends.</description>

      <description>I have been recently messing around with the new ggfx package.

&amp;mdash; üìà Len Kiefer üìä (@lenkiefer) March 4, 2021  Most of my applications (see below for a gallery) have maybe not been applying good dataviz guidelines. But I think I have found a good example.
We can use the ggfx::with_blend function to layer a recession indicator with a time series and color code the lines.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I gave a virtual lecture on data visualization at GMU. Here I‚Äôm posting the slides I used for that talk and including my discussion notes for the portion of the talk where I discussed guidelines for data visualization.
At the beginning of the talk I spoke a bit about data visualization guidelines. I framed this part of my talk around Jon Schwabish‚Äôs five guidelines from his new book Better Data Visualizations see (on Amazon) and here for a blog summary.</description>

      <title>Talking Dataviz</title>

      <guid>http://lenkiefer.com/2020/12/15/talking-dataviz/</guid>
      <description>Today I got to talk #dataviz and shared a bunch of my charts, which always sort of feels like sharing my vacation photos. But it was fun to talk about why I made some of these charts, what they mean, and how different data visualization techniques can bring out new insights in familiar data.
The pdf version is below or here.
The pptx version has animations, get it here.</description>

      <title>New Research Paper Inequality During the COVID-19 Pandemic The Case of Savings from Mortgage Refinancing</title>

      <description>For several months now, I‚Äôve been working on a new research paper with Sumit Agarwal, Souphala Chomsisengphet, Hua Kiefer, and Paolina Medina studying refinance activity this year.
When we started the project back in the spring we were not sure that the pandemic would allow households to refinance at rates similar to prior periods. It seemed possible that the pandemic would disrupt the mortgage market and make it difficult for households to take advantage of historically low rates.</description>

      <title>y-axis on the right side</title>
      <link>http://lenkiefer.com/2020/11/20/y-axis-on-the-right-side/</link>

      <guid>http://lenkiefer.com/2020/11/20/y-axis-on-the-right-side/</guid>
      <description>Recently I‚Äôve been putting my y-axis labels on the right for some time series.
I think this idea has been rattling around in my head since it was suggested on Twitter by Maarten Lambrechts:
A y-axis on the left is almost always the default, while the most recent and usually most relevant data are on the right. Then shouldn&amp;#39;t a y-axis on the right be the default (when there are no data labels), to improve legibility?</description>

      <description>Yesterday I shared with you observations on the economy, which form the core of many of my recent economic outlook talks. In that article I used some charts with alternative formatting. No not spooky, but a blue theme kind of like those alternative road uniforms some sportsball teams wear.
Here, I will share with you the R code for these delicious plots.
SetupFirst we‚Äôll need to set up our chart theme, tweak some ggplot2 defaults and load some libraries.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I completed the elusive presentation quadfecta. I did a talk on Zoom, Teams, WebEx and Skype. These communication apps are great, but after a few hours of maintaining ‚Äúresting Zoom face‚Äù (you want to look interested as the camera is always rolling), I felt a bit exhausted.
But it was totally worth it. The highlight for me was being able to join Jeffrey Shaffer, Steve Wexler, Amanda Makulec, and Andy Cotgreave for Chart Chat.</description>

      <description>This could have been a tweet. Sometimes it is a tweet.
After I have taken a break from social media, blogging, etc and I try to get back in the swing I find it incredibly difficult to get restarted. I feel enormous pressure to say something insightful, something funny, something grand.
An effective strategy is not to shoot for the stars. Rather than writing something great, I set my sights lower.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm hearing that folks have been invited to speak at the upcoming Rstudio conference. Congratulations to the folks who got accepted this year.
I am not sure if I‚Äôm going to go to the conference this year, but I recommend you consider it if you love R. I spoke there last year, giving an E-Poster. It was a lot of fun. The best part was getting a chance to meet other R enthusiasts.</description>

      <description>Found in TranslationOn a hill in Kyoto, Japan there is a most delightful sign. Near the Kiyomizu Temple temple in the Higashiyama District there are several picturesque streets. The presevered historic district is a favorite place for tourist shopping, tasty snacks, photo opportunities with majestic temples in the background.
Many folks like to rent Kimonos (mostly women, but also a few men) and snap photos in the street. On my way through the district I happened across this wonderful sign attached to a private residence:</description>

      <description>On intrinsic irreducible uncertainty of economic outcomes (forecasting is hard)Here‚Äôs a picture of me and some bears. Don‚Äôt worry, I didn‚Äôt get hurt. Those bears couldn‚Äôt hurt anybody. First, because they are behind some glass. And second, because they are stuffed.
There are a lot of stuffed bears out there. They‚Äôve grown aggressive lately. Maybe because they haven‚Äôt eaten much. This current economic expansion is over 10 years old now.</description>

I made the slides with R and the xaringan package. You can easily print the html to pdf with Chrome. The pdf version is below and available at this link.

      <description>Last week I gave a speech in Cincinnati, Ohio at the UC/PNC Economic Outlook program. My speech was titled ‚ÄúForecasting in a Vulnerable Economy‚Äù. You can find slides and detailed notes over on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/forecasting-vulnerable-economy-leonard-kiefer/.
In this post I want to share R code for the first three plots on the Vulnerable Economy.
We‚Äôll get the data via the St Louis Fed‚Äôs FRED. We‚Äôre going to grab the Fed Funds rate FEDFUNDS, the Unemployment Rate UNRATE the Congressional Budget Office‚Äôs estimate of the long-run natural rate of unemployment NROU and the spread between the 10-year and 2-year U.</description>

      <description>I really like R, but I love the R community. Since I‚Äôve started using R intensively in the past couple of years, I‚Äôve constantly been awed and inspired by all the amazing things that people are doing with R. The spirit of the open source community and people‚Äôs willingness to share their thoughts and code is fantastic.
Many times in this space we‚Äôve remixed different data visualizations with R, often relying on awesome new packages that others have developed.</description>

      <description>WE ARE ON OUR WAY TOWARDS BUILDING a tidy PowerPoint workflow. In this post I want to build on my earlier posts (see here for an introduction and here for a more sophisticated approach) for building a PowerPoint presentation with R and try to make it even purrrtier.
I saw that somebody shared my posts on reddit and I thought I would take a look at the comments. Folks on the internet are known for kindness and offering helpful advice right?</description>

See the attached PowerPoint .pptx file for all the charts.
Here‚Äôs a gif version I started with:
Then after I created the PowerPoint I started messing around with the drawing tools and made increasingly ill-advised edits.</description>

      <description>LOOK I DON‚ÄôT HAVE ANYTHING BAD TO SAY about PowerPoint. Others have said it (see for example Tufte and Harvard Business Review). It‚Äôs a tool and a fact of life for many of us.
I am interested in making better PowerPoints. In this post we‚Äôll use some R tools to generate a PowerPoint deck.
OfficeRThe package officer allows you to access and manipulate ‚ÄòMicrosoft Word‚Äô and ‚ÄòMicrosoft PowerPoint‚Äô documents from R.</description>
