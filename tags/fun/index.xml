      <description>I want to share with you a fun rose chart. No not the Nightingale chart (see Jeff Shaffer). Rather weâ€™re talking about a cool generative chart, that fit in a tweet from @aschinchon [https://twitter.com/aschinchon]:

      <description>Earlier this week, I made a boss chart:

&amp;mdash; ðŸ“ˆ Len Kiefer ðŸ“Š (@lenkiefer) May 12, 2020  While listening to Chart Chat I heard Jeffrey Shaffer, Steve Wexler, Amanda Makulec, and Andy Cotgreave discuss tornado charts. I decided it might be a good idea to make one. Because Iâ€™m not sure I can trust with the awesome power inherent in these charts I wonâ€™t post R code here.</description>

      <description>Economist Play-in Round
Bracket madness is about the descend on us. Before we get to March Madness weâ€™ll have to suffer through a different kind of madness: the Neoliberal Shill Bracket. This year the Neoliberal project has succumbed to inflation and has expanded the field. This year features a play-in round.
In this post we analyze the Economist Play-in:

      <description>Recently I have been running R from my Android phone. There are some apps on the Google Play Store that seem to let you emulate R, or connect to a remote version. Instead of doing that, I have been running R directly off my phone using the terminal.
Rocking now
Writing, running #rstats scripts from the terminal with Emacs, pulling data from Fred, making chartz,
All from my oh so very smart phone https://t.</description>

{
df[i,1] &amp;lt;- df[i-1,1]+((0.98)^i)*cos(i)

      <description>On Twitter Claus Wilke asks:
Dear Lazyweb: Is there an accepted name for a plot showing a two-variable time series as a path in the x-y plane? #dataviz@Elijah_Meeks @albertocairo @lenkiefer @sharoz @dataandme pic.twitter.com/N8Edmf8qii
&amp;mdash; Claus Wilke (@ClausWilke) July 21, 2018  I call them connected scatterplots, and weâ€™ve made a few here. See for example this post.
But we can intensify things and make a plot like this:
hey @ClausWilke why stop at a 2-d connected scatterplot* when you could go to 3-d</description>

      <description>In the real world, when I give talks and use slides I am typically constrained in my aesthetic. Often Iâ€™m speaking at a work-related thing and we have a corporate template and color scheme. They serve us well and Iâ€™ve found restraint helps focus on the message. Usually Iâ€™m setting out to inform, so direct, repeatable and easy to follow are key.
But I also like to explore new ideas and different themes on the side.</description>

      <description>TIME FOR A FUN NEW MORTGAGE RATE CHART.
This one:
Weâ€™ll use R to plot a new visualization of mortgage rates.
Letâ€™s make it.
DataAs we did with our majestic mortgage rate plot post weâ€™ll plot mortgage rates using the Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey.
Weâ€™ll get the mortgage rates data via the Saint Louis Federal Reserveâ€™s FRED database. If you followed my post from back in April of last year you know what we can do if we combine FRED with the quantmod package.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Game</title>

      <guid>http://lenkiefer.com/2018/03/12/forecasting-game/</guid>
      <description>LETâ€™S PICK BACK UP where we left off and think about communicating forecast results. To help guide our thinking, letâ€™s set up a little game.
Basic setupLike last time weâ€™re going to focus on a situation where a forecaster observes some information about the world and makes an announcement about a future binary outcome. A decision maker observes the forecasterâ€™s announcement and takes a binary action. Then the outcome is realized and the forecaster receives a payoff.</description>

      <description>Spring is nearly upon us, or at least we can hope. Letâ€™s examine how housing activity typically rounds into shape as the weather warms up. Weâ€™ll make some fun plots with R.
Seasonality in housing dataHousing market activity in the United States is highly seasonal. Consider this animated plot.
This plot shows U.S. new home sales. Often the data are presented seasonally adjusted, but this plot is for non seasonally adjusted data.</description>

      <description>COME AND MAKE A MAJESTIC MORTGAGE RATE PLOT WITH ME.
Weâ€™ll use R to plot a few visualizations of mortgage rates.
I recently gave a number of talks about the economic outlook and housing. One point I like to make is that mortgage rates are low. Iâ€™ve shown this through a variety of visualizations. But one of my favorites looks like this:

      <description>I HAVE BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH A NEW WAY TO VISUALIZE DATA, a bivariate tilegridmap. When I get around to rolling out my tidyPowerPoint workflow weâ€™re going to want something other than bars and lines to fill it up. A graph like this might be a fun option.
Weâ€™ll build one, but first, just let me show you one I tweeted earlier today:

      <description>Iâ€™ve BEEN MESSING AROUND MORE WITH R and OFFICER and having too much fun for a Monday. Iâ€™m going to dive into some details later, but Iâ€™ll just leave a couple files here.
See the attached PowerPoint .pptx file for all the charts.
Hereâ€™s a gif version I started with:
Then after I created the PowerPoint I started messing around with the drawing tools and made increasingly ill-advised edits.</description>
