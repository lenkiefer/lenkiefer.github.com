&amp;mdash; ðŸ“ˆ Len Kiefer ðŸ“Š (@lenkiefer) May 12, 2020  While listening to Chart Chat I heard Jeffrey Shaffer, Steve Wexler, Amanda Makulec, and Andy Cotgreave discuss tornado charts.

      <description>Economist Play-in Round
Bracket madness is about the descend on us. Before we get to March Madness weâ€™ll have to suffer through a different kind of madness: the Neoliberal Shill Bracket. This year the Neoliberal project has succumbed to inflation and has expanded the field. This year features a play-in round.
In this post we analyze the Economist Play-in:

      <description>Recently I have been running R from my Android phone. There are some apps on the Google Play Store that seem to let you emulate R, or connect to a remote version. Instead of doing that, I have been running R directly off my phone using the terminal.
Rocking now
Writing, running #rstats scripts from the terminal with Emacs, pulling data from Fred, making chartz,
All from my oh so very smart phone https://t.</description>

      <description>COME AND MAKE A MAJESTIC MORTGAGE RATE PLOT WITH ME.
Weâ€™ll use R to plot a few visualizations of mortgage rates.
I recently gave a number of talks about the economic outlook and housing. One point I like to make is that mortgage rates are low. Iâ€™ve shown this through a variety of visualizations. But one of my favorites looks like this:
Letâ€™s make it.
DataWeâ€™ll plot mortgage rates using the Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey.</description>

      <description>Iâ€™ve BEEN MESSING AROUND MORE WITH R and OFFICER and having too much fun for a Monday. Iâ€™m going to dive into some details later, but Iâ€™ll just leave a couple files here.
See the attached PowerPoint .pptx file for all the charts.
Hereâ€™s a gif version I started with:
Then after I created the PowerPoint I started messing around with the drawing tools and made increasingly ill-advised edits.</description>
