      <description>This could have been a tweet. Sometimes it is a tweet.
After I have taken a break from social media, blogging, etc and I try to get back in the swing I find it incredibly difficult to get restarted. I feel enormous pressure to say something insightful, something funny, something grand.
An effective strategy is not to shoot for the stars. Rather than writing something great, I set my sights lower.</description>

      <description>Over the summer I spent a few weeks in Asia. One of the places I visited was Fushimi Inari-taisha in Kyoto, Japan. This shrine is situated on a beautiful mountain. What really struck me about this place was the vibrant colors used in the Torii gates and to decorate some of the fox statues like these:
The color got stuck in my head, so I decided to look up the hex code here and created a modified ggplot2 theme using the color.</description>

      <description>Found in TranslationOn a hill in Kyoto, Japan there is a most delightful sign. Near the Kiyomizu Temple temple in the Higashiyama District there are several picturesque streets. The presevered historic district is a favorite place for tourist shopping, tasty snacks, photo opportunities with majestic temples in the background.
Many folks like to rent Kimonos (mostly women, but also a few men) and snap photos in the street. On my way through the district I happened across this wonderful sign attached to a private residence:</description>

      <description>Hey check it out!
Me on a podcast: https://policyviz.com/podcast/episode-111-len-kiefer/.
We talk about data visualization and how I use it at work. A bit about using R too.
I got the opportunity to talk with Jon Schwabish on the Policyviz podcast. Jon’s PolicyViz blog has a lot of cool data visualization stuff, including chart remakes and thoughtful discussion. There’s a bunch of other neat stuff on the page too.
So check out the podcast and take a look around the page, there’s a lot of useful stuff there.</description>

      <title>Hello Hugo! Hello Blogdown!</title>

      <description>ALL RIGHT! LOOKS LIKE WE’RE BACK ONLINE.
I took the opportunity to try out the newly released blogdown R package and migrate my blog over from Jekyll to Hugo.
This blog has been up for just over two years and Jekyll was working fine, but I never felt really comfortable. I’m guessing that the Blogdown package will become enormously popular and it seems that Hugo has more flexibility for me.</description>
