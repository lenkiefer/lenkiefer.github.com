      <description>THIS MORNING I SAW AN INTERESTING CHART OVER ON BLOOMBERG. In this post they compared recent 10-year Treasury yield movements with the Taper Tantrum in 2013. The chart you can see here was an area chart with overlapping line plots.
I thought it would be a fun exercise to remix a similar chart with R.
Eventually it will look like this:
Let’s make our remix and try out a few alternative plots.</description>

      <description>We will get back to house prices soon.
IN THIS POST I WANT TO EXPLORE EMPLOYMENT TRENDS at the state and metro area. Today the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released data on state and metro area employment trends. Last month we looked at unemployment trends. Today we’ll look at trends in nonfarm employment.
Wrangling the dataWe will be importing, preparing, and plotting our data with R. We can get the data pretty easily using the files BLS prepares, though we have to do a little bit of work to organize the data.</description>

      <description>A dataviz remix I came across some interesting analysis from Josh Lehner at the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis about the &amp;ldquo;Housing Trilemma&amp;rdquo;.
The Housing Trilemma, captured in the chart below is based on the following claim:
 Every city wants to have a strong local economy, high quality of life and housing affordability for its residents. Unfortunately these three dimensions represent the Housing Trilemma. A city can achieve success on two but not all three at the same time.</description>

      <description>Tight Inventory EARLIER THIS WEEK, Trulia published a post by Chief Economist Ralph McLaughlin called &amp;ldquo;House Arrest: How Low Inventory Is Slowing Home Buying&amp;rdquo;. The article analyzed trends in housing inventory.
Trulia broke housing inventory into &amp;ldquo;starter homes&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;move-up homes&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;premium homes&amp;rdquo;. They found that the inventory of available homes for-sale has shifted towards premium homes and away from starter homes that first time homebuyers would typically be buying.</description>
