      <description>Every week I track a lot of data. One useful source is the Mortgage Bankers Association Weekly Applications Survey. This survey provides a timely, high frequency (weekly) reading on the U.S. mortgage market. Most weeks I make a bunch of charts related to the release, often posting them on Twitter:
Here&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;ve been interpreting the hot recent housing market data. Still a lot of catch up from a lost spring.</description>

      <description>Coronavirus RecessionOver on LinkedIn I posted a summary of recent economic talks I have been giving: The Coronavirus Recession. Read the whole things for analysis and lots of charts, but I leave off with three key questions:
Recession was here, but is it already gone?Housing market indicators have rebounded, but will the recovery be sustained?After effects of shutdown and possible second wave to the pandemic remain as risks to the outlook, how big are these risks?</description>

      <description>Yesterday I completed the elusive presentation quadfecta. I did a talk on Zoom, Teams, WebEx and Skype. These communication apps are great, but after a few hours of maintaining ‚Äúresting Zoom face‚Äù (you want to look interested as the camera is always rolling), I felt a bit exhausted.
But it was totally worth it. The highlight for me was being able to join Jeffrey Shaffer, Steve Wexler, Amanda Makulec, and Andy Cotgreave for Chart Chat.</description>

      <description>The past week we started to get monthly economic data from March, after the U.S. economy shut down to battle the COVID-19 pandemic. The results were sobering.
We already knew the US labor market was in a tough spot. But last week we got data for housing starts and retail sales which showed the size of the economic contraction.
Below are some charts I posted to Twitter last week.</description>

      <description>Today the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment situation summary for March 2020. While many were expecting the U.S. labor market to show some weakness as the U.S. economy shuts down to battle COVID-19, the magnitude of the contraction surprised many. Because the reference week for the employment report was March 8th through March 14th, before the nationwide shutdown took full effect, many were expecting a relatively mild report.</description>

      <description>I have been thinking about how the recent volatility could impact the economy. If travel and tourism contract due to fears of a pandemic, the impact will differ in markets around the United States. One way to think about this is to compute the Location Quotient, or the percentage of the employment in an area that is in the leisure and hospitality industry.
Conside the graphic below:
This map shows areas (states and core based statistical areas) color-coded by their location quotient.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve been thinking about how different macroeconomic shocks might affect the U.S. housing market. Given recent volatility it is hard to know how to size risks. But it could be a useful exercise to think through how certain typical shocks might impact the housing market.
Rather than take on a full structural approach, I just want to extend the reduced form VAR analysis we did in a post from last year.</description>

      <description>Mortgage interest rates have moved about a percentage point lower from where they were a year ago. The housing market seems to have responded favorably.
On my way into D.C. the other day to do some business, I joined a Twitter exchange originally between [at]Graykimbrough and Adam Ozimek, [at]ModeledBehavior about the effects of Federal Reserve interest policy on the housing market.
Seems unlikely housing market was slowed by trade war.</description>

      <description>On intrinsic irreducible uncertainty of economic outcomes (forecasting is hard)Here‚Äôs a picture of me and some bears. Don‚Äôt worry, I didn‚Äôt get hurt. Those bears couldn‚Äôt hurt anybody. First, because they are behind some glass. And second, because they are stuffed.
There are a lot of stuffed bears out there. They‚Äôve grown aggressive lately. Maybe because they haven‚Äôt eaten much. This current economic expansion is over 10 years old now.</description>

      <description>Earlier this month I attended the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) annual policy conference in Washington D.C. LINK. One of the keynote speeches was by Alan Greenspan. During his remarks, Greenspan mentioned that while economic forecasting was hard demographic projections were the surest thing in an uncertain business.
Demographics of course are not easy, but it‚Äôs much easier to guess what the population of 30 years olds will be in 5 years than it is the predict the unemployment rate or GDP in 5 years.</description>

      <description>My recent economic and housing market talks see for example here have been titled: ‚ÄúWill the U.S. housing market get back on track in 2019?‚Äù. My general conclusion has been cautiously optimistic. There is enough strength in the broader economy and enough of a tailwind from demographic forces to push the U.S. housing market to modest growth next year.
I still think that‚Äôs true, but as I have said in my talks, risks are weighted to the downside.</description>

      <description>LAST FRIDAY WAS JOBS FRIDAY, the day when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases its monthly employment situation report. This report is blanketed with media coverage and economist and financial analysts all over the world pay close attention to the report. The employment situation gives a read on trends in the world‚Äôs largest economy‚Äôs labor market. It also provides a clue about how monetary policy might unfold, affecting bond yields around the world.</description>

      <description>LET US TAKE A LOOK AT HOUSE PRICE AND EMPLOYMENT TRENDS.
House prices in the Unitest States have been increasing at a rapid pace, about 7 percent on an annual basis. How does that relate to employment growth? And how do those trends vary by geography. Let‚Äôs take a look.
Per usual, I will post R code and you can follow along.
DataFollowing recent posts (see here and here for example), we will use the Freddie Mac House Price Index an Excel spreadsheet can be downloaded here.</description>

      <description>EARLIER THIS WEEK I TWEETED out a poll asking whether or not folks wanted to see a thread/tweetstorm with slides from an upcoming presentation on the economy and housing markets that I‚Äôm giving. Over 90 percent voted for a thread. So I shared it. In this post let me add a little more commentary on the individual slides.
Here‚Äôs the thread I ended up posting:

      <description>THE UNITED STATES IS NOT building enough homes to meet demand. Be sure to check out my upcoming presentation at Realtor University to learn more about whether or not this could mean a house price bubble.
One reason often cited for low levels of construction is a lack of labor. How do construction trends compare to construction employment? Let‚Äôs take a look.
Financial blogger Logan Mohtashami (Twitter, blog) tweeted out (he‚Äôs a power Twitter user so I‚Äôm not sure exactly when or where, so I probably saw it multiple places) an interesting observation on housing construction and employment (see blog post).</description>

      <description>LET US REVIEW HOUSING MARKET TRENDS in the United States through the first three quarters of 2017.
Economic backgroundThe overall economic environment remains favorable for housing. Interest rates are low, the labor market has been solid and income growth, while modest, has begun to tick up.
Low mortgage ratesFor most of 2017 mortgage rates have declined. Rates entered the year above 4 percent for the 30-year fixed rate mortgage, but after peaking in March, declined through September.</description>

      <description>BACK WE GO INTO THE VASTY DEEP. LAST TIME we introduced the idea of using dynamic model averaging to forecast recessions. I was so excited about the new approach that I didn‚Äôt take the time to break down what was going on with it. In this post we‚Äôll look more closely at what‚Äôs happening with the dma packaged when we try to forecast recessions.

      <description>LET‚ÄôS LOOK AT NEW HOME SALES. Today the U.S. Census Bureau joint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) released new home sales estimates through September of 2017.
New home sales have been grinding higher along with housing starts, though they dipped last month (maybe). This month‚Äôs report was the strongest since 2007, as I tweeted earlier today:
New home sales in September highest since 2007.

In this post, I want to use the tidyquant package to wrap some of the plots we made earlier into a flexdashboard.
I‚Äôll have more to say about this in the near future, but I just wanted to make a simple flexdashboard (partially to remind myself how to do it).</description>

Mortgage rates back below 4 percentThe 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell back below 4 percent this week.
New home salesNew home sales data was released and came in weaker than expected for April 2017. March has been an extremely strong number, so a decline was anticipated, but the drop was bigger than most expected.</description>

      <description>EARLIER THIS WEEK the Census Bureau released the latest Housing Vacancy Survey (HVS) data for the first quarter of 2016.
Much attention went to the homeownership rate estimates, which showed a decline in homeownership rates near a 48-year low. The gif below shows the history of the homeownership rate as estimated by the HVS.
And here&amp;rsquo;s a still image of the same data:
Vacancy rates In addition to the homeownership rate, the HVS data contained estimates of both the homeowner and rental vacancy rates.</description>

      <description>THIS WAS A BUSY WEEK for housing data. On Monday, the NAHB released the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI), which tracks home builder sentiment. On Tuesday we got New Residential Construction from Census/HUD which gives us housing starts and permits. On Wednesday we got Existing Home Sales (EHS) from the National Association of Realtors. And on Thursday (along with mortgage rates), we got the FHFA House Price Index.</description>

      <description>EARLIER THIS WEEK the U.S. Census Bureau released updated population figures for 2015. These data revealed changes in population across the country. Jed Kolko published a nice summary of these data, and it got me thinking about the relationship of population growth rates and house prices. In this post I want to consider a few key things I found by exploring these data.
First, let‚Äôs have a look at the history of real house prices, relative to the year 2000 for 30 large metro areas:</description>

      <description>Tight Inventory EARLIER THIS WEEK, Trulia published a post by Chief Economist Ralph McLaughlin called &amp;ldquo;House Arrest: How Low Inventory Is Slowing Home Buying&amp;rdquo;. The article analyzed trends in housing inventory.
Trulia broke housing inventory into &amp;ldquo;starter homes&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;move-up homes&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;premium homes&amp;rdquo;. They found that the inventory of available homes for-sale has shifted towards premium homes and away from starter homes that first time homebuyers would typically be buying.</description>

      <description>Mid-week chart update With existing home sales, house prices, and new home sales being released, this is one of the busiest weeks of the month for housing data. We‚Äôll catch new home sales tomorrow morning, but let‚Äôs catch our breath and recap what we‚Äôve learned so far this week.
Existing home sales disappoint The National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported on existing home sales (EHS) on Monday. Existing home sales for February surprised most by dropping 7.</description>

      <description>This past week I tracked several data releases that give us an idea of the health and vibrancy of the economy and housing markets.
State employment trends positive Consistent with the national employment numbers  state employment trends are positive. The BLS reported on employment trends by state for January 2016 this week. Eleven states plus DC had a statistically significant month-to-month increases in employment and five states experienced month-to-month declines.</description>

      <description>Resilient job growth SPRING IS ALMOST HERE, and housing market activity will start to accelerate as we enter the peak homebuying season in the spring and summer months. The latest jobs report  shows the U.S. labor market continues to pick up steam, adding 242,000 jobs month-over-month and beating expectations. Job growth has been resilient since the end of the Great Recession in June 2009, with monthly job growth averaging over 200,000 since 2011.</description>

National house prices rise 6.2% Freddie Mac released its full year 2015 house price index and an interactive data visualization. The seasonally-adjusted national index increased 6.2 percent year-over-year and is now 29.6 percent above the post-recession low, and just 4.1 percent below the (nominal) pre-recession peak (see graph below).
While national house price growth has been strong, there is considerable variation across the country. Some states and metro areas are already well above their pre-recession (nominal) peak, while other still have lots of ground to make up.</description>

Making a data viz SOMETIMES ANIMATION CAN BE USEFUL, though it is often misused. I&amp;rsquo;ve been tracking the week-to-week changes in mortgage rates, and animating with a GIF.
Example animated gif with mortgage rates from 1/1/2013 to 3/10/2016 I build my gif using the R statistical package.
Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll explain more of the details later, but the R code below uses the ggplot2, ggthemes and animation packages to create the plots, style them, and save the animation.</description>

Are wages increasing&amp;hellip;or is it merely a trick of the light? We got this week&amp;rsquo;s charting started with some data from last week. The jobs report  came out last Friday (see our discussion from last week) .</description>

The week ahead Next week there are several data releases but the two that I‚Äôm paying especially close attention to are the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) and Housing Starts, part of the New Residential Construction joint release by Census and HUD.
Will builders maintain their sunny outlook? The HMI is a diffusion index based on survey questions about homebuilder‚Äôs attitudes. Values of the index above 50 indicate that on balance, more respondents feel positive than negative about the current conditions in and direction of the single-family housing market.</description>
