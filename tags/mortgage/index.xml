      <title>New Research Paper Inequality During the COVID-19 Pandemic The Case of Savings from Mortgage Refinancing</title>

      <description>For several months now, I‚Äôve been working on a new research paper with Sumit Agarwal, Souphala Chomsisengphet, Hua Kiefer, and Paolina Medina studying refinance activity this year.
When we started the project back in the spring we were not sure that the pandemic would allow households to refinance at rates similar to prior periods. It seemed possible that the pandemic would disrupt the mortgage market and make it difficult for households to take advantage of historically low rates.</description>

      <description>We are entering the homestretch for 2020, with just about two months left. It has been an intense year, with many twists and turns. Given all the uncertainty many people have been asking me to share my perspective on the outlook for US housing and mortgage markets. I‚Äôve given many talks, in this article I‚Äôm laying out the basic view that forms the core of my recent presentations.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated recession are of course the dominant drivers of the outlook.</description>

      <description>Earlier today I tweeted out an update of our skyline mortgage rate chart. Gray Kimbrough (follow him on Twitter to get all your Millennial Myths busted) pointed out that my chart style was close to famous art style of Joy Division‚Äôs 1979 album Unknown Pleasures.
That was exactly right, because I arrived at the skyline mortgage rate chart by tweaking my original application of ‚Äòggridges::geom_density_ridges‚Äô (formerly known as Joyplot) code to arrive there.</description>

      <description>Mortgage interest rates have moved about a percentage point lower from where they were a year ago. The housing market seems to have responded favorably.
On my way into D.C. the other day to do some business, I joined a Twitter exchange originally between [at]Graykimbrough and Adam Ozimek, [at]ModeledBehavior about the effects of Federal Reserve interest policy on the housing market.
Seems unlikely housing market was slowed by trade war.</description>

&amp;mdash; üìà Len Kiefer üìä (@lenkiefer) October 10, 2019  This was an update to a visualization we have talked about here.

The code for the inflation plot is pretty simple.</description>

      <description>The U.S. housing market stalled out a bit in 2018 and we aren‚Äôt building enough homes to match demand. See my recent speech for details on what‚Äôs going on. Abbreviated version: in 2018 mortgage interest rates slowed housing activity, but demographic forces support housing demand and should provide a lift in years to come. Together with a recent moderation in mortgage rates there‚Äôs reason to be optimistic about housing market activity in 2019.</description>

      <description>Let‚Äôs compare two charts. ‚ÄúYour chart‚Äù, or a chart that might come virtually unedited from spreadsheet software versus the chart your boss told you not to worry about:
Your chart is perfectly serviceable and for a quick exploration might be perfectly fine. However, why routinely generate such charts if you have the ability to make something a bit more dynamic? Being able to produce more interesting charts might not be necessary, but it also probably doesn‚Äôt hurt.</description>

      <description>THIS MORNING I SAW AN INTERESTING CHART OVER ON BLOOMBERG. In this post they compared recent 10-year Treasury yield movements with the Taper Tantrum in 2013. The chart you can see here was an area chart with overlapping line plots.
I thought it would be a fun exercise to remix a similar chart with R.
Eventually it will look like this:
Let‚Äôs make our remix and try out a few alternative plots.</description>

      <description>COME AND MAKE A MAJESTIC MORTGAGE RATE PLOT WITH ME.
We‚Äôll use R to plot a few visualizations of mortgage rates.
I recently gave a number of talks about the economic outlook and housing. One point I like to make is that mortgage rates are low. I‚Äôve shown this through a variety of visualizations. But one of my favorites looks like this:
Let‚Äôs make it.

      <description>MORTGAGE RATES ARE LOW IN THE UNITED STATES. How low? Let‚Äôs take a look.
We‚Äôll use R to plot a few visualizations of mortgage rates. We‚Äôll also try out some of the nice features in the tibbletime package that help when working with time series data. For more on using tibbletime see this post and this one on making animated plots.
Since I was already called out for alleged chartcrimes, I‚Äôm going to go ahead and let loose here.</description>

      <description>WHAT TIME IS IT? TIME FOR TIBBLETIME! In this post, I‚Äôm going to take the tibbletime package out for a spin. Turns out this package is quite useful for things I tend to do.
We‚Äôll use the tibbletime package to write some R code to extend our ongoing analysis of trends in the U.S. mortgage market (see here for example).
Davis Vaughan (on Twitter) one of the authors of the tibbletime package suggested I take a look:</description>

      <description>TIME FOR ANOTHER DATA WRANGLING AND VISUALIZATION EXTRAVAGANZA. This time we are going to work hard to turn some big data into little data. That is, we‚Äôre going to work hard to aggregate several million loan level records into useful summary graphics to tell us about the U.S. mortgage market in 2016.
I‚Äôve been working on a lot of different ways to visualize trends in the mortgage market (see here and here for examples).</description>

      <description>I AM WORKING ON ADDING some more analysis around mortgage origination trends (see here for a high level summary).
It‚Äôs on the way, but let me just leave a few graphs for you. These are updated versions of the same ones we made last year.
These infographics show the distribution of mortgage loan amounts by state/county and metro area.
For the beeswarm plots (see for example, Flowing Data) plots I have randomly sampled 2,000 loans from each state/metro area.</description>

      <description>IT IS SEPTEMBER AND THAT MEANS it is data release season. One of the most important September data releases for me is the annual HMDA data release.
These data provide the closest thing to a publicly-available comprehensive summary of U.S. mortgage market activity that we‚Äôll get (for right now). The recently released data is for 2016 and provides a detailed view of mortgage market activity across the country. Let‚Äôs take a look.</description>

We‚Äôll just do a quick description of the data and then follow up with a static chart and an animated gif.

This summer I was fortunate to spend some time at the Pompidou Centre in Paris. The Pompidou Centre houses the largest collection of modern art in Europe. I really enjoyed their collection of abstract and minimalist paintings.
Well, turns out we can make our own abstract-style art using a Kandinsky R package from Giora Simchoni.</description>

Be sure to check out my earlier post for more discussion of the underlying data. Here we‚Äôll pick up where we left off and make some more graphs using R.
Just a quick reminder (read the earlier post for all the details), we have a dataset that includes household level observations for the 20 largest metro areas in the United States for 2010 and 2015 (latest data available).</description>

      <description>This past week I tracked several data releases that give us an idea of the health and vibrancy of the economy and housing markets.
State employment trends positive Consistent with the national employment numbers  state employment trends are positive. The BLS reported on employment trends by state for January 2016 this week. Eleven states plus DC had a statistically significant month-to-month increases in employment and five states experienced month-to-month declines.</description>

Making a data viz SOMETIMES ANIMATION CAN BE USEFUL, though it is often misused. I&amp;rsquo;ve been tracking the week-to-week changes in mortgage rates, and animating with a GIF.
Example animated gif with mortgage rates from 1/1/2013 to 3/10/2016 I build my gif using the R statistical package.
Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll explain more of the details later, but the R code below uses the ggplot2, ggthemes and animation packages to create the plots, style them, and save the animation.</description>

The week ahead Next week there are several data releases but the two that I‚Äôm paying especially close attention to are the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) and Housing Starts, part of the New Residential Construction joint release by Census and HUD.
Will builders maintain their sunny outlook? The HMI is a diffusion index based on survey questions about homebuilder‚Äôs attitudes. Values of the index above 50 indicate that on balance, more respondents feel positive than negative about the current conditions in and direction of the single-family housing market.</description>
