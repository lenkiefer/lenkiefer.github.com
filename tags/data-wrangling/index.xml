      <description>Been a while since I blogged here. Where does time go? On Twitter, I realized itâ€™s just about time for spooky plots:
U.S. existing home sales hit a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6 million in August 2020, first time at 6 million since 2006 pic.twitter.com/4ZKrO2d0zN
&amp;mdash; ðŸ“ˆ Len Kiefer ðŸ“Š (@lenkiefer) September 22, 2020  Maybe too early?
In this post, I want to share a simple R code pattern thatâ€™s been useful for me.</description>

      <description>Earlier this week, I made a boss chart:

&amp;mdash; ðŸ“ˆ Len Kiefer ðŸ“Š (@lenkiefer) May 12, 2020  While listening to Chart Chat I heard Jeffrey Shaffer, Steve Wexler, Amanda Makulec, and Andy Cotgreave discuss tornado charts. I decided it might be a good idea to make one. Because Iâ€™m not sure I can trust with the awesome power inherent in these charts I wonâ€™t post R code here.</description>

      <title>Real House Price Trends</title>

      <description>Let us take a look at house price trends in the United States and across states and metro areas.
Earlier this week I tweeted out a few charts on housing market trends.
In most of the middle part of the country over the past 44 years there has been little growth in real (inflation-adjusted) house prices.
In coastal states, a very different story. pic.twitter.com/PLbiNftha3
&amp;mdash; ðŸ“ˆ Len Kiefer ðŸ“Š (@lenkiefer) July 10, 2019  In this post weâ€™ll analyze real house prices since 1975, and per usual use R to wrangle data and make plots.</description>

      <description>WHAT TIME IS IT? TIME FOR TIBBLETIME! In this post, Iâ€™m going to take the tibbletime package out for a spin. Turns out this package is quite useful for things I tend to do.
Weâ€™ll use the tibbletime package to write some R code to extend our ongoing analysis of trends in the U.S. mortgage market (see here for example).
Davis Vaughan (on Twitter) one of the authors of the tibbletime package suggested I take a look:</description>

      <title>Analyzing mortgage data with R</title>

      <description>TIME FOR ANOTHER DATA WRANGLING AND VISUALIZATION EXTRAVAGANZA. This time we are going to work hard to turn some big data into little data. That is, weâ€™re going to work hard to aggregate several million loan level records into useful summary graphics to tell us about the U.S. mortgage market in 2016.
Iâ€™ve been working on a lot of different ways to visualize trends in the mortgage market (see here and here for examples).</description>

      <title>PURRRty PowerPoint with R</title>

      <guid>http://lenkiefer.com/2017/09/27/use-purrr/</guid>
      <description>IN THIS POST I WANT TO GO THROUGH SOME EXAMPLES of using the purrr package for R.
Now there are already some great examples of how to use purrr. If youâ€™re brand new to purrr (like I was not long ago) probably start with Jenny Bryanâ€™s Purrr tutorial then see R for Data Science and also this presentation from rstudioconf (pdf). You can also check out this curated collection via Mara Averick (on Twitter: dataandme ) for a bunch of examples.</description>

      <description>LETâ€™S WRANGLE SOME HOUSING DATA.
Weâ€™ll try something different with how posts are organized. In the past I have generally mixed data wrangling, R code and graphs all in one post. Now Iâ€™m going to break it up. Posts like yesterday will just show some data and discuss it. Then, if the data wrangling or code is complicated enough Iâ€™ll follow up with another post with details.
Youâ€™ll be able to find all my posts on data wrangling, under the data wrangling tag and R code under the R tag.</description>

      <description>IN THIS POST I WANT TO CREATE some data visualizations with R using the recently released Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data.
For this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to return to the 2015 HMDA that you can get from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) webpage and I discussed earlier.
Check out my prior post for more discussion of how we build these data visualizations.

      <description>IN MY PREVIOUS POST we looked at the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data and plotted a Beveridge Curve. In this post I want to add some more code that allows us to plot Beveridge Curves by industry.
For more on the analysis of industry-specific Beveridge Curves, see this paper published in the June 2012 Monthly Labor Review that decomposes shifts in the Beveridge Curve and looks at it by industry.</description>

      <description>IN THIS POST WE&amp;rsquo;LL LOOK AT recent job openings and hires data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS).
R code for selected graphs posted below
Job openings and labor turnover Total nonfarm trends Let&amp;rsquo;s start by looking at aggregate national trends for total nonfarm sector. The plot below compares hires, job openings and separations (the sum of quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations) over time.</description>

      <description>EARLIER THIS WEEK THE U.S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS released data on consumer expenditures in 2015. In this post I want to examine these data and make a few visualizations. R code for graphs posted below
One area I pay close attention to is housing. Housing is the largest single category of expenditure, averaging about 1/3 of total consumer expenditures. The BLS breaks the data out by tenure, so we can see how expenditures vary by owners versus renters.</description>

      <description>AUGUST IS ALMOST OVER, and it&amp;rsquo;s nearly back to school season. And that means one thing. No, not that we&amp;rsquo;re about to get a chance to watch the #1 NCAA football program of all time dominate the gridiron (though that&amp;rsquo;s awesome too). No, it&amp;rsquo;s data release season! A data swarm is on its way.
From American Community Survey to the American Housing Survey to the annual Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Data many statistical data releases come out in September and October.</description>

      <description>TODAY the NEW YORK FEDERAL RESERVE BANK released its Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit. These data come from the Center for Microeconomic Data based on credit records from Equifax.
R code for the graphs are posted at bottom of page
Trends in household debt balances One of the key statistics tracked in the report (full data can be found here) is household debt balances. They break debt balances out by loan type:</description>
