      <description>I recently gave a talk on housing markets, beginning with some observations and asking a few pressing questions.
U.S. house prices are increasing at about a 20 percentage point annual rate in recent months, the highest rate of growth ever recorded.
The level of real (inflation-adjusted) house prices is the highest in 131 years of house price data stretching back to 1890.
What does this mean for the housing market?</description>

      <description>Last week the U.S. Commerce Department reported the advance estimate for annual economic growth for 2020. For the full year, US gross domestic product contracted 3.5 percentage points, the largest annual decline since the 11.6 percentage point contraction in 1946. The similarities pretty much end there.
In 1946 the US economy was demobilizing after finishing the fight against fascism. Factories were shuttered that had been producing munitions, fighter planes, tanks and liberty ships, while the G.</description>

      <description>VISUAL MEDITATIONS are the analysis of repeated graphs of the same data with variations on a graphical theme. When altering the mapping of data to aesthetics sometimes interesting patterns emerge. I find it a useful practice. I made a series of these a few years ago with different charts. The chart images have been lost to past blog migrations, but the code should still work.
In this post, I want to consider several alternative ways to visualize house prices.</description>

      <description>Today the FHFA released their house price index for August 2020. Per the report house prices in August 2020 increased 1.5 percentage points over the prior month (19.6% at an annualized rate). Over the last 12-months US house prices have increased 8%, and over the last 3-months they have risen over 15% on an annualized basis. That is an acceleration of over 7.5 percentage points, the largest turnaround in house price growth since the inflection point in 2009.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve been thinking about distributional forecasts. In particular I‚Äôve been considering Quantile Autoregressions (QAR) as defined in KOENKER AND XIAO 2006. There are some handy lecture notes I‚Äôll borrow from at this link (pdf) in the exercise here.
This is all speculative, but I think this might be a useful way to think about the assymetry in likely outcomes given the uncertainty inherent in today‚Äôs economic forecasts.

      <description>On Friday a colleague showed me an interesting chart, a map of maps. I believe the original was made in Tableau, but I decided to spin one up in R. I tweeted out the picture:

      <description>Let us take a look at house price trends in the United States and across states and metro areas.
Earlier this week I tweeted out a few charts on housing market trends.
In most of the middle part of the country over the past 44 years there has been little growth in real (inflation-adjusted) house prices.
In coastal states, a very different story. pic.twitter.com/PLbiNftha3
&amp;mdash; üìà Len Kiefer üìä (@lenkiefer) July 10, 2019  In this post we‚Äôll analyze real house prices since 1975, and per usual use R to wrangle data and make plots.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve got a new working paper with Hua Kiefer (FDIC) and Diana Wei (OCC) that studies the dynamics of house prices and foreclosure rates across space and time. We estimate a model using a panel of state/quarters where nearby states influence one another.

I tweeted out the following chart comparing house prices and state population dynamics.

      <description>HEY! HERE IS A VIDEO SHOWING HOUSE PRICE TRENDS around the United States.
Earlier this year we looked at how to get the data and plot it using R.
I made the video using the PowerPoint to .mp4 workflow I outlined here.
Below I‚Äôll review how to build this file.

      <description>LET US REVIEW HOUSING MARKET TRENDS in the United States through the first three quarters of 2017.
Economic backgroundThe overall economic environment remains favorable for housing. Interest rates are low, the labor market has been solid and income growth, while modest, has begun to tick up.
Low mortgage ratesFor most of 2017 mortgage rates have declined. Rates entered the year above 4 percent for the 30-year fixed rate mortgage, but after peaking in March, declined through September.</description>

      <description>Introduction HOUSE PRICES HAVE NOW RECOVERED BACK TO THEIR PRE-RECESSION PEAK, at least according to some indices. The Freddie Mac House Price Index, for example, surpassed its pre-2008 peak in the latest release for data through September 2016. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll be exploring trends in house prices and exploring different ways of showing how far house prices have come, and in some cases, how far they still have to go.</description>
