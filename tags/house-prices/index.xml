      <description>I‚Äôve been thinking about distributional forecasts. In particular I‚Äôve been considering Quantile Autoregressions (QAR) as defined in KOENKER AND XIAO 2006. There are some handy lecture notes I‚Äôll borrow from at this link (pdf) in the exercise here.
This is all speculative, but I think this might be a useful way to think about the assymetry in likely outcomes given the uncertainty inherent in today‚Äôs economic forecasts.

      <description>On Friday a colleague showed me an interesting chart, a map of maps. I believe the original was made in Tableau, but I decided to spin one up in R. I tweeted out the picture:

You see pretty strong spatial correlation, with some interesting exceptions. Florida correlated with AZ, NV pic.twitter.com/9hzwZLkb41

      <description>Let us take a look at house price trends in the United States and across states and metro areas.
Earlier this week I tweeted out a few charts on housing market trends.
In most of the middle part of the country over the past 44 years there has been little growth in real (inflation-adjusted) house prices.
In coastal states, a very different story. pic.twitter.com/PLbiNftha3
&amp;mdash; üìà Len Kiefer üìä (@lenkiefer) July 10, 2019  In this post we‚Äôll analyze real house prices since 1975, and per usual use R to wrangle data and make plots.</description>

I‚Äôm giving a seminar about my new working paper ‚ÄúWhat Happens in Vegas Doesn‚Äôt Always Stay in Vegas‚Äù‚Äú. The slides for the talk are posted below.
I made the slides with R and the xaringan package. You can easily print the html to pdf with Chrome. The pdf version is below and available at this link.

      <description>I‚Äôve got a new working paper with Hua Kiefer (FDIC) and Diana Wei (OCC) that studies the dynamics of house prices and foreclosure rates across space and time. We estimate a model using a panel of state/quarters where nearby states influence one another.

      <description>In this post I want review some trends in U.S. housing supply and demand. Specifically I want to look at county level trends in population, housing supply (the total number of housing units) and house prices. We‚Äôll uncover some interesting trends.
Per usual we will make our graphics with R. Preparing the data required several steps that I will outline in a follow up post. For now we‚Äôll just proceed with the data I‚Äôve put together.</description>

      <description>In this post I want to share updated plots comparing house price trends around the world. Or at least part of the world. Our view will be somewhat limited, based on data, but will at least allow us to see how U.S. house prices compare to a few other countries.
The details behind these plots are explained in more detail in this post, but some of the images were lost due to my blog transition.</description>

&amp;mdash; üìà Len Kiefer üìä (@lenkiefer) August 1, 2018  It‚Äôs a remix of a chart we made here, though it uses a different index. In the earlier post, we used the FHFA house price index, but this one used the Case-Shiller Index, which was released today.
Let me just post two gifs and then below will be the R code I used to create them.</description>

      <description>I saw today, via Ropensci a blog post about a new package for making animated gifs with R called gifski now available on CRAN.
Let‚Äôs adapt the code we shared last week to use the gifski package. See that post for additional details.
If we run the R code below we‚Äôll generate this animated plot:
This plot shows the evolution of house prices in two states, California (CA) and Texas (TX) versus the United States (USA).</description>

      <description>In this post we will create some plots of house prices and incomes for the United States and individual states. We will also try out the bea.R package to get data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.
We‚Äôll end up with something like this:
Per usual we‚Äôll do it with R and I‚Äôll include code so you can follow along.

      <description>LET US TAKE A LOOK AT HOUSE PRICE AND EMPLOYMENT TRENDS.
House prices in the Unitest States have been increasing at a rapid pace, about 7 percent on an annual basis. How does that relate to employment growth? And how do those trends vary by geography. Let‚Äôs take a look.
Per usual, I will post R code and you can follow along.
DataFollowing recent posts (see here and here for example), we will use the Freddie Mac House Price Index an Excel spreadsheet can be downloaded here.</description>

      <description>SO TODAY I SPENT SOME TIME WITH THE KIDDOS and contemplated the Enlightenment, so I didn‚Äôt have time to write up some code. But I will post a couple images that I think are interesting.
I‚Äôve got two plots for you, both using geofacets. See this post on using the geofacet package in R to make plots like these.
The first plot shows U.S. house price trends by metro area from January 2015 to December 2017.</description>

      <description>LAST YEAR WE TOURED recent house price trends Post. Let‚Äôs update the data visualizations with data through December 2017.
We are going to show house price trends using data from the publicly available Freddie Mac House Price Index.
Animation:
Here‚Äôs an updated animation showing trends in the top 20 metro areas, based on population.
Below, I‚Äôll plot stills for each of the 20 metro areas. Later I‚Äôll follow up with some additional visualizations and some commentary.</description>

      <description>EARLIER TODAY THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU released new estimates of population for U.S. states from 2010 through 2017. Let‚Äôs see how population trends look compared to recent house price growth.
We‚Äôll combine the Census estimates for state population with the Freddie Mac House Price Index.
The chart below plots population growth rates by state from July of 2010 to July of 2017 against house price appreciation rates over that same period.</description>

      <description>LET US REVIEW HOUSING MARKET TRENDS in the United States through the first three quarters of 2017.
Economic backgroundThe overall economic environment remains favorable for housing. Interest rates are low, the labor market has been solid and income growth, while modest, has begun to tick up.
Low mortgage ratesFor most of 2017 mortgage rates have declined. Rates entered the year above 4 percent for the 30-year fixed rate mortgage, but after peaking in March, declined through September.</description>

      <description>LET US FOLLOW UP ON YESTERDAY‚ÄôS POST with some more analysis of housing affordability.
Per usual, we‚Äôll use R to generate the plots and I‚Äôll share the code below.
Measuring affordabilityFirst, let‚Äôs talk a little bit more about what we are seeing in the plots. What are we measuring? Affordability metrics are often based on market level summary statistics. In our case we are looking at various ways to measure housing costs at a market level.</description>

      <description>IN LATE 2016 HOUSE PRICES recovered back to their pre-recession peak. At least nationally. At least not adjusted for inflation. Let‚Äôs talk about it.
National trendsThe chart below shows the Freddie Mac House Price Index (link to source) for the United States from December 2000 to December 2016.
Prior to the Great Recession, house prices reached their seasonally-adjusted peak in March of 2007. Prices fell from 2007 (with a brief interruption due to the first time homebuyer tax credit) to December 2011 when they reached their post-recession minimum.</description>

      <description>Introduction HOUSE PRICES HAVE NOW RECOVERED BACK TO THEIR PRE-RECESSION PEAK, at least according to some indices. The Freddie Mac House Price Index, for example, surpassed its pre-2008 peak in the latest release for data through September 2016. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll be exploring trends in house prices and exploring different ways of showing how far house prices have come, and in some cases, how far they still have to go.</description>

      <description>OVER THE PAST THREE MONTHS I HAVE MADE several new house price visualizations. In these meditations I&amp;rsquo;ll consider some recent graphs and provide R code for them. For reference, prior meditations are available at:
 Part 1: data wrangling  Part 2: sparklines and dots (animated)  Part 3: bubbles and bounce  Part 4: graph gallery   Meditation 1: Median sales price trends Earlier this week, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) released their quarterly update on metro area median house prices (data here).</description>

      <description>IntroductionIN THIS POST we‚Äôll collect several visualizations of house prices I‚Äôve shared on Twitter the past few days and have a little discussion. In prior posts I‚Äôve also included code for some of these graphs, and the others are mostly straightforward extensions of the earlier examples.
This is Part 4 of my series of posts on visualizing house prices. Below are the earlier posts that have data and R code for generating plots:</description>

      <description>IN THIS POST I‚Äôm going to describe how to make some additional data visualizations of house prices and discuss a bit about what they mean. For reference, the prior posts are available at:
Part 1: data wranglingPart 2: sparklines and dots (animated)Meditation 1: BubblesLet‚Äôs start by recreating this visualization:
This visualization plots each state (plus the District of Columbia) as a blue dot in a scatterplot.</description>

      <description>IntroductionTHIS POST CONSIDERS recent trends in house prices. Thinking a great deal about house prices, I like to look at many different DATA VISUALIZATIONS of house prices, at the national, state, and metro levels of aggregation. Also, in this post, I will include descriptions of how I built my visualizations, including code. These meditations as I call them, required some data wrangling and some thinking as to how to construct the charts.</description>

      <description>THIS IS PART TWO of my series of meditations on house prices. In our earlier post we covered the data collection, wrangling, and some useful transformations.
RecapFor convenience, the data files you‚Äôll need to replicate these results are right here:
state and national called fmhpi.txtmetro called fmhpi2.txtAnd the data preparation code is here in the previous post
Now we‚Äôll need to load and prepare some data.</description>

      <description>TO HELP UNDERSTAND TRENDS in house prices, I have a couple of data visualizations for the Freddie Mac house price index.
Viz 1: House Price Dynamics The first compares the quarterly and annual appreciation for house prices across the 50 states plus the District of Columbia.
In this visualization, each dot represent a state (or D.C.). The horizontal X axis measures the quarter-over-quarter annualized percentage change in the Freddie Mac house price index.</description>

      <description>EARLIER THIS WEEK the U.S. Census Bureau released updated population figures for 2015. These data revealed changes in population across the country. Jed Kolko published a nice summary of these data, and it got me thinking about the relationship of population growth rates and house prices. In this post I want to consider a few key things I found by exploring these data.
First, let‚Äôs have a look at the history of real house prices, relative to the year 2000 for 30 large metro areas:</description>
