      <description>Today the FHFA released their house price index for August 2020. Per the report house prices in August 2020 increased 1.5 percentage points over the prior month (19.6% at an annualized rate). Over the last 12-months US house prices have increased 8%, and over the last 3-months they have risen over 15% on an annualized basis. That is an acceleration of over 7.5 percentage points, the largest turnaround in house price growth since the inflection point in 2009.</description>

      <description>Earlier today I tweeted out an update of our skyline mortgage rate chart. Gray Kimbrough (follow him on Twitter to get all your Millennial Myths busted) pointed out that my chart style was close to famous art style of Joy Division‚Äôs 1979 album Unknown Pleasures.
That was exactly right, because I arrived at the skyline mortgage rate chart by tweaking my original application of ‚Äòggridges::geom_density_ridges‚Äô (formerly known as Joyplot) code to arrive there.</description>

      <description>Let‚Äôs update our earlier analysis to examine the Federal Reserve‚Äôs Beige Book.
Following my earlier post, we can construct a sentiment measure for each report. It turns out that after turning sharply negative in spring, the October 2020 report returned to positive territory.
The sentiment index looks at all words and after adjusting for economics terms (like gross) we score them for sentiment. We could just count up the number of times we see words like ‚Äústong‚Äù vs words like ‚Äúweak‚Äù.</description>

      <description>About a year ago I made a chart and Bob Rudis dubbed it a skyline chart. Here‚Äôs an updated version I made today.
The chart shows a historgram over US weekly average 30-year mortgage rates by year broken into 1/8 percentage points buckets. We see that through this past week, 30-year mortgage rates had spend eight weeks around 2.875 percent.

      <description>Every week I track a lot of data. One useful source is the Mortgage Bankers Association Weekly Applications Survey. This survey provides a timely, high frequency (weekly) reading on the U.S. mortgage market. Most weeks I make a bunch of charts related to the release, often posting them on Twitter:
Here&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;ve been interpreting the hot recent housing market data. Still a lot of catch up from a lost spring.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve been thinking about distributional forecasts. In particular I‚Äôve been considering Quantile Autoregressions (QAR) as defined in KOENKER AND XIAO 2006. There are some handy lecture notes I‚Äôll borrow from at this link (pdf) in the exercise here.
This is all speculative, but I think this might be a useful way to think about the assymetry in likely outcomes given the uncertainty inherent in today‚Äôs economic forecasts.

      <description>Yesterday I announced that I wrote a simple R package darklyplot. This is a vignette I have built to help explain ways you can use the package.
The goal of darklyplot is to create simple time series plots with a dark background. The miniminum and maximum values are highlighted, and color coded along with the y axis and x axis labels. This vignette walks through basic usage and explores some of the package options.</description>

      <guid>/2020/07/02/a-new-r-package-darklyplot/</guid>
      <description>Today I try my hand at building an R package called darklyplot. This package is a little extension of ggplot2 to create a dark themed time series plot.
This packages lets you create simple dark-theme times series plots. It extends ggplot2 and relies on mdthemes to make color coded axis labels. The axis labels use ggthemes::geom_rangeframe to create Tufte-like axes. Through parameters, the user can alter the colors, include shading under the line, and also add a single reference line.</description>

      <description>Over on Twitter Grant McDermott shares a neat ggplot2 trick:
A shortcut I like to use is calling multiple geoms in an lapply() call, since this automatically generates a list. Works well for investigating plotting variations, e.g.
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat)) +
lapply(c(50,200), function(b) geom_histogram(bins=b, alpha=0.3)) https://t.co/hf0vtvDkbk pic.twitter.com/jmmqlyJEKo
&amp;mdash; Grant McDermott (@grant_mcdermott) June 22, 2020  I applied this trick to create a gradient fill for a chart.
Looks kind of like Kool-Aid.</description>

      <description>Coronavirus RecessionOver on LinkedIn I posted a summary of recent economic talks I have been giving: The Coronavirus Recession. Read the whole things for analysis and lots of charts, but I leave off with three key questions:
Recession was here, but is it already gone?Housing market indicators have rebounded, but will the recovery be sustained?After effects of shutdown and possible second wave to the pandemic remain as risks to the outlook, how big are these risks?</description>

      <description>Yesterday I completed the elusive presentation quadfecta. I did a talk on Zoom, Teams, WebEx and Skype. These communication apps are great, but after a few hours of maintaining ‚Äúresting Zoom face‚Äù (you want to look interested as the camera is always rolling), I felt a bit exhausted.
But it was totally worth it. The highlight for me was being able to join Jeffrey Shaffer, Steve Wexler, Amanda Makulec, and Andy Cotgreave for Chart Chat.</description>

      <description>The past week we started to get monthly economic data from March, after the U.S. economy shut down to battle the COVID-19 pandemic. The results were sobering.
We already knew the US labor market was in a tough spot. But last week we got data for housing starts and retail sales which showed the size of the economic contraction.

      <description>Today the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment situation summary for March 2020. While many were expecting the U.S. labor market to show some weakness as the U.S. economy shuts down to battle COVID-19, the magnitude of the contraction surprised many. Because the reference week for the employment report was March 8th through March 14th, before the nationwide shutdown took full effect, many were expecting a relatively mild report.</description>

      <description>I have been thinking about how the recent volatility could impact the economy. If travel and tourism contract due to fears of a pandemic, the impact will differ in markets around the United States. One way to think about this is to compute the Location Quotient, or the percentage of the employment in an area that is in the leisure and hospitality industry.

      <description>I shared a chart recently on Twitter that got some attention:

&amp;mdash; üìà Len Kiefer üìä (@lenkiefer) November 14, 2019  But not just any attention (though I do appreciate all your likes and retweets). This was special. Robert Allison [at]RobertAllison__ at SAS replicated the chart with SAS software and wrote a blog about it. These mortgage rates look shady to me. I worked on a lot of SAS stuff early in my days working at Freddie Mac, and Robert‚Äôs SAS graph examples were a resource I often used.</description>

      <description>This could have been a tweet. Sometimes it is a tweet.
After I have taken a break from social media, blogging, etc and I try to get back in the swing I find it incredibly difficult to get restarted. I feel enormous pressure to say something insightful, something funny, something grand.
An effective strategy is not to shoot for the stars. Rather than writing something great, I set my sights lower.</description>

      <description>Mortgage interest rates have moved about a percentage point lower from where they were a year ago. The housing market seems to have responded favorably.
On my way into D.C. the other day to do some business, I joined a Twitter exchange originally between [at]Graykimbrough and Adam Ozimek, [at]ModeledBehavior about the effects of Federal Reserve interest policy on the housing market.
Seems unlikely housing market was slowed by trade war.</description>

      <description>This post is for me and future me, though if you get something out of that, that‚Äôs great too. Here I will jot down some notes on something I‚Äôve been thinking about.
Because reasons, I have been interested in Vector Error Correction Models (VECM). I‚Äôve been thinking of the case where you estimate an error correction model, and have available external forecasts for one of the variables. How can you easily construct the conditional forecasts for the VECM in R?</description>

To fit it into a tweet, I had to squeeze things down a bit.
Slightly more verbose, and using fredr to get data from FRED using their API. You‚Äôll need an API key from FRED. These data happen to be for New Private Housing Units Authorized by Building Permits - in Structures with 1 Unit.</description>

What really struck me about this place was the vibrant colors used in the Torii gates and to decorate some of the fox statues like these:
The color got stuck in my head, so I decided to look up the hex code here and created a modified ggplot2 theme using the color.</description>

There are a lot of stuffed bears out there. They‚Äôve grown aggressive lately. Maybe because they haven‚Äôt eaten much. This current economic expansion is over 10 years old now.</description>

Earlier this week I tweeted out a few charts on housing market trends.
In most of the middle part of the country over the past 44 years there has been little growth in real (inflation-adjusted) house prices.
In coastal states, a very different story. pic.twitter.com/PLbiNftha3

      <description>If I cannot send Adam Ozimek (at Modeled Behavior ) a Diet Pepsi, then the next best thing might be a chart about epop. epop is the term economists use to describe the employment-to-population ratio, a useful summary statistic about the labor market. Perhaps the summary statistic. Adam (and others) has been talking about epop as a key labor market statistic for years. It seems the Federal Reserve is catching on to the usage of the term epop (though many economists over there have been looking at the statistic for a long while too).</description>

      <description>The current economic expansion is set to enter its tenth year this summer. Assuming we make it to June, this will become the longest U.S. economic expansion in recorded history stretching back to the 19th century. But how is the housing market doing? After a decade of recovery housing market activity still has room for improvement, but trends in 2018 were negative. Home sales, housing construction and house price growth all declined in 2018.</description>

Demographics of course are not easy, but it‚Äôs much easier to guess what the population of 30 years olds will be in 5 years than it is the predict the unemployment rate or GDP in 5 years.</description>

      <description>The U.S. housing market stalled out a bit in 2018 and we aren‚Äôt building enough homes to match demand. See my recent speech for details on what‚Äôs going on. Abbreviated version: in 2018 mortgage interest rates slowed housing activity, but demographic forces support housing demand and should provide a lift in years to come. Together with a recent moderation in mortgage rates there‚Äôs reason to be optimistic about housing market activity in 2019.</description>

In this space, I‚Äôve shared several posts on animation see tags. But I haven‚Äôt been using gganimate. Instead, I took a more direct approach building the animations via loops and trying to tween directly if I wanted a smooth animation. This level of control is nice, but frankly the defaults in gganimate work better than many of my attempts to hand craft it.</description>

Let‚Äôs take a step back and look at how forecasts of U.S. macro variables have evolved. Is forecasting still hard?
Last year we looked at historical forecasts of economic conditions in the post forecasting is hard. Let‚Äôs update it.</description>

      <description>My recent economic and housing market talks see for example here have been titled: ‚ÄúWill the U.S. housing market get back on track in 2019?‚Äù. My general conclusion has been cautiously optimistic. There is enough strength in the broader economy and enough of a tailwind from demographic forces to push the U.S. housing market to modest growth next year.
I still think that‚Äôs true, but as I have said in my talks, risks are weighted to the downside.</description>

      <description>U.S. housing markets have slowed down in 2018. Housing construction, which is still running well below both historical averages and what the U.S. currently needs to meet rising demand has stalled out this year.
The current level of housing construction is close to the level we‚Äôve seen in recession periods. And the historical comparison stretching back decades is comparing a nation with significantly fewer households. Total U.S. households for example, in 1970 were about 1/2 (63 million) of what they were in 2017 (126 million) FRED chart.</description>

      <description>My studies involve a lot of data organized in space and across time. I look at housing data that usually captures activity around the United States, or sometimes the world, and almost always over time.
In my data visualization explorations I like to study different ways to visualize trends across both space and time, often simultaneously.
Let‚Äôs consider a couple here in this post. Per usual we will make our graphics with R.</description>

      <description>Textmining is an exciting topic. There is tremendous potential to gain insights from textual analysis. See for example Gentzko, Kelly and Taddy‚Äôs Text as Data. While text mining may be quite advanced in other fields, in finance and economics the application of these techniques is still in its infancy.
In order to take advantage of text as data, economists and financial analysts need tools to help them. Fortunately, there is a great resource: Text Mining with R by Julia Silge (blog and on Twitter atjuliasilge) and David Robinson (blog and on Twitter atdrob).</description>

      <description>Indications are that U.S. housing market activity in the middle part of 2018 has moderated. Home sales estimates for both new home sales and existing home sales declined on a seasonally adjusted basis in June relative to May. House price growth has also moderated recently. Some folks have gotten animated about the recent trends.
I‚Äôm more sanguine about the recent data. Certainly a slowdown in housing market activity would be cause for concern.</description>

      <description>I try not to use too much jargon (jargon monoxide can be deadly) on this blog. But I‚Äôve got a bit of a technical term I‚Äôve been using the describe U.S. residential construction: super-low.
To be sure, housing construction has been grinding higher, but it‚Äôs been taking a while for activity to get back close to historical averages. Once you account for the larger population, which all else equal needs more housing units, the level of construction is quite low.</description>

      <description>Let‚Äôs compare two charts. ‚ÄúYour chart‚Äù, or a chart that might come virtually unedited from spreadsheet software versus the chart your boss told you not to worry about:
Your chart is perfectly serviceable and for a quick exploration might be perfectly fine. However, why routinely generate such charts if you have the ability to make something a bit more dynamic? Being able to produce more interesting charts might not be necessary, but it also probably doesn‚Äôt hurt.</description>

      <description>As an economist with a background in econometrics and forecasting I recognize that predictions are often (usually?) an exercise in futility. Forecasting, after all, is hard. While non-economists have great fun pointing this futility out, many critics miss out on why it‚Äôs so hard.
There are at least two reasons why forecasting is hard. The first, the unknown future, is pretty well understood. Empirical regularities with much forecasting power in the social sciences are hard to come by and are rarely stable.</description>

      <description>IN MY LINE OF WORK, (finance/economics) you see a lot of dual axis line charts. I am of the opinion that dual y axis charts are sort of evil. But in this post I‚Äôm going to make one. It‚Äôs for a totally legit reason though.
Like in an earlier post we‚Äôll make a graph similar to one I saw on xenographics. Xenographics gives examples of and links to ‚Äúweird, but (sometimes) useful charts‚Äù.</description>

      <description>TODAY WAS JOBS FRIDAY. LET‚Äôs create a couple plots to show the trend in employment growth.
Each month the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases its employment situation report. Let‚Äôs make a couple plots looking at trends in U.S. nonfarm payrolls.
Per usual, let‚Äôs make a graph with R.
DataWe can easily get the data via the Saint Louis Federal Reserve‚Äôs FRED database. If you followed my post from back in April of last year you know what we can do if we combine FRED with the quantmod package.</description>

      <description>IN THIS POST WE SHALL EXPLORE VALUE-SUPRESSING UNCERTAINTY PALETTES.
One of my favorite new sites is xenographics that gives examples of and links to ‚Äúweird, but (sometimes) useful charts‚Äù. The examples xenographics gives are undoubtedly interesting and might help inspire you if you‚Äôre looking for something new.
One new (to me) graphic was something called Value-Suppressing Uncertainty Palettes (VSUP). See this research paper (pdf). VSUPs ‚Äúallocate larger ranges of a visual channel when uncertainty is low, and smaller ranges when uncertainty is high‚Äù.</description>

      <description>I LIKE TO MAKE ANIMATIONS WITH R. Sometimes folks ask me how they add to understanding. They don‚Äôt always, but often, particularly when you are working with time series, I find they help visualize trends and understand the evolution of variables.
I‚Äôve written several posts on animation, see particularly this recent post on making a simple line plot and this post about improving animations with tweenr.
Tweenr is a handy package that lets you interpolate data and make smooth animations.</description>

      <description>LET‚ÄôS PICK BACK UP where we left off and think about communicating forecast results. To help guide our thinking, let‚Äôs set up a little game.
Basic setupLike last time we‚Äôre going to focus on a situation where a forecaster observes some information about the world and makes an announcement about a future binary outcome. A decision maker observes the forecaster‚Äôs announcement and takes a binary action. Then the outcome is realized and the forecaster receives a payoff.</description>

This report is blanketed with media coverage and economist and financial analysts all over the world pay close attention to the report. The employment situation gives a read on trends in the world‚Äôs largest economy‚Äôs labor market. It also provides a clue about how monetary policy might unfold, affecting bond yields around the world.</description>

      <description>LAST WEEK IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL an article LINK talked about how pundits can strategically make probabilistic forecasts. It seems 40% is a sort of magic number, where it‚Äôs high enough that if the event comes true you can claim credit as a forecaster, but if it doesn‚Äôt happen, you still gave it less than 50/50 odds.
Since I‚Äôm often asked to make forecasts I‚Äôm interested in this problem.</description>

      <description>LET US TAKE A LOOK AT HOUSE PRICE AND EMPLOYMENT TRENDS.
House prices in the Unitest States have been increasing at a rapid pace, about 7 percent on an annual basis. How does that relate to employment growth? And how do those trends vary by geography. Let‚Äôs take a look.
Per usual, I will post R code and you can follow along.

I thought it would be a fun exercise to remix a similar chart with R.
Eventually it will look like this:

      <description>LET US REVIEW HOUSING MARKET TRENDS in the United States through the first three quarters of 2017.
Economic backgroundThe overall economic environment remains favorable for housing. Interest rates are low, the labor market has been solid and income growth, while modest, has begun to tick up.
Low mortgage ratesFor most of 2017 mortgage rates have declined. Rates entered the year above 4 percent for the 30-year fixed rate mortgage, but after peaking in March, declined through September.</description>

In this post we‚Äôll look more closely at what‚Äôs happening with the dma packaged when we try to forecast recessions.
Per usual we‚Äôll do it with R and I‚Äôll include code so you can follow along.</description>

      <description>LET‚ÄôS LOOK AT NEW HOME SALES. Today the U.S. Census Bureau joint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) released new home sales estimates through September of 2017.
New home sales have been grinding higher along with housing starts, though they dipped last month (maybe). This month‚Äôs report was the strongest since 2007, as I tweeted earlier today:
New home sales in September highest since 2007.

      <description>I HAVE BEEN BUILDING SOME NEW VISUALIZATIONS to study house price trends. In particular I have been thinking about rates of change of rates of change, or accelerations and decelerations in house price trends. I‚Äôve got more to say on this topic, but for today, let‚Äôs create a few visualizations and contemplate an animation.
Per usual we‚Äôll use R to create some plots.

      <description>The 100 second crisis About 100 seconds into every talk I give there comes a crisis.
This note is about that crisis and how I try to overcome it. If you&amp;rsquo;re in a situation where you give a presentation or speech-I call them &amp;ldquo;talks&amp;rdquo;-you might experience your own 100 second crisis. Perhaps my strategy could work for you.
The first 99 seconds Let&amp;rsquo;s begin with those first 99 seconds when things are going well.</description>

      <description>IT IS TIME FOR AN UPDATE ON HOUSE PRICE TRENDS AROUND THE UNITED STATES.
I have been experimenting with some new visualizations and updating some old favorites. Let‚Äôs collect them here.
This post will be an extension of my Visual Meditations on House Prices series from last year. Check out those posts for additional visualizations.
DataWe‚Äôll use the recently updated Freddie Mac House Price Index (link to source) data and use R to create some plots.</description>

      <description>I LOOK AT A LOT OF DATA and the thing about data is it‚Äôs not always what it seems to be. A lot of data are uncertain, and based on estimates.
We‚Äôve talked about this before. See for example, this post on visualizing uncertainty in housing data. In this post I‚Äôm going to combine one of my favorite new plot types, the joyplot (see this post) with another of my favorite plot types: the beeswarm plot (see this post for more on beeswarm plots).</description>

      <description>THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GET A BIT MORE ABSTRACT IN THIS SPACE. Today we make some Kandinsky-style images with R.
This summer I was fortunate to spend some time at the Pompidou Centre in Paris. The Pompidou Centre houses the largest collection of modern art in Europe. I really enjoyed their collection of abstract and minimalist paintings.
Well, turns out we can make our own abstract-style art using a Kandinsky R package from Giora Simchoni.</description>

      <description>LET US FOLLOW UP ON YESTERDAY‚ÄôS POST with some more analysis of housing affordability.
Per usual, we‚Äôll use R to generate the plots and I‚Äôll share the code below.
Measuring affordabilityFirst, let‚Äôs talk a little bit more about what we are seeing in the plots. What are we measuring? Affordability metrics are often based on market level summary statistics. In our case we are looking at various ways to measure housing costs at a market level.</description>

Mortgage rates back below 4 percentThe 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell back below 4 percent this week.
New home salesNew home sales data was released and came in weaker than expected for April 2017. March has been an extremely strong number, so a decline was anticipated, but the drop was bigger than most expected.</description>

      <description>SO WE HAVE BEEN PLOTTING A LOT OF INDEX VALUES LATELY. It‚Äôs been great. But you have questions. Great questions.
I got an interesting response to my house price dot chart over Twitter regarding the house price index we were plotting. User [@chrisschnabel](https://twitter.com/chrisschnabel) wondered how the choice of starting point influenced how the house price dot chart looked.
@lenkiefer This is a great viz, but conclusions will be drawn based on the date of the index.</description>

In this post we‚Äôll try out a new way to visualize recent house price trends with R.
Just this wekeend I saw a new package geofacet for organizing ggplot2 facets along a geographic grid. It allows use to construct a small multiple graph that roughly looks like the United States. (Thanks to [@yoniceedee](https://twitter.com/yoniceedee) for recommending geofacet).

      <description>HOUSING DATA ARE OFTEN MEASURED WITH CONSIDERABLE uncertainty. Estimates are usually based on small samples that are subject to sampling variability. The various government statistical agencies usually report estimates of uncertainty with their releases. For example, both the New Residential Construction and New Residential Sales reports include estimates of sampling uncertainty along with their point estimates.
In this post I want to explore ways to visualize sampling uncertainty with R.</description>

      <description>THIS PAST MONTH HAS BEEN BUSY. People have been traveling, I‚Äôve been traveling, kids have been sick, and we‚Äôve had the March Madness basketball keeping me occupied. Today I wanted to just explore a little analysis I‚Äôve put together on resampling.
Because reasons I‚Äôve recently been interested in sample sizes and how quickly certain estimates might converge.
There is of course, a vast literature on this topic. But armed with powerful computers maybe we can avoid too much mathy work and try to simulate our way through some problems.</description>

      <description>LET US BUILD ON YESTERDAY‚ÄôS POST (LINK) and construct more VISUALIZATIONS of house prices. In this post, I‚Äôll include some R code so you can play along.
We are going to construct our own GRAND TOUR (Wikipedia) except instead of touring European antiquity, we will explore recent trends in house prices around the continental United States. But we will perhaps still pick up some culture, or at least a new ggplot2 theme.</description>

      <description>IN LATE 2016 HOUSE PRICES recovered back to their pre-recession peak. At least nationally. At least not adjusted for inflation. Let‚Äôs talk about it.
National trendsThe chart below shows the Freddie Mac House Price Index (link to source) for the United States from December 2000 to December 2016.
Prior to the Great Recession, house prices reached their seasonally-adjusted peak in March of 2007. Prices fell from 2007 (with a brief interruption due to the first time homebuyer tax credit) to December 2011 when they reached their post-recession minimum.</description>

      <description>THERE IS A LOVELY BOOK on writing style called ‚ÄúClear and Simple as the Truth‚Äù by Francis-No√´l Thomas and Mark Turner (webpage). In it Thomas and Turner distinguish between several writing styles including practical style and classic style. Practical style‚Äôs mode is description, while classic style‚Äôs is presentation (see description).
It strikes me that a similar distinction could be made when exploring statistics. Often, when we are exploring data we are in description mode.</description>

89% of Canadians have more than 25% equity in their homes. Avg equity ratio is 74%. Nearly 40% of Canadians have their homes fully paid off. pic.twitter.com/mAfkO38Kg2‚Äî Big Ben Myers (@benmyers29) December 8, 2016@benmyers29 pointed out that homeowner equity in Canada was quite high, with only about 1% of Canadian mortgaged residential properties underwater (where the mortgage amount is greater than the property value so homeowner equity is negative) per this report referenced in the tweet.</description>

      <description>IntroductionIN ORDER TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT‚ÄôS GOING ON with the economy, housing and mortgage markets I spend a great deal of time thinking about interest rates. Interest rates, specifically mortgage rates are very important to housing and mortgage markets. In my professional life I work on tracking trends in housing and mortgage markets, and that includes mortgage rates. I create a lot of visualizations of mortgage rates.</description>

      <description>IntroductionI HAVE BEEN WATCHING SOME VIDEOS of Plotcon 2016. All of the videos I‚Äôve watched are worth watching (check out the playlist), but I was particularly interested in this one from Hadley Wickham:
Among other things Hadley talks about the idea of nesting data frames, models and model results within a data frame. That idea struck me as something that could be quite useful and not at all something that could lead to explosive increase in the size of data frames or unending loops.</description>

      <description>IT WAS A BUSY WEEK FOR ECONOMIC AND HOUSING DATA this week. Below are some data visaulizations I made tracking key trends in economic and housing market data.
Homeowner equity increases to $12.7 Trillion in the second quarter of 2016 With house prices rising by nearly 6 percent on a year-over-year basis, homeowners are building back equity. According to the Federal Reserve&amp;rsquo;s Flow of Funds, owners&amp;rsquo; equity in real estate was $12.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ll recap these data and events through charts I&amp;rsquo;ve created and shared throughout the week.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share each of the charts with some commentary, and then below, I&amp;rsquo;ll include the R code I used to generate the charts.</description>

      <description>IN THIS POST WE&amp;rsquo;RE GOING to make an animated version of the famous Federal Reserve dot plot comparing the dots in March 2016 to June 2016. As far as celebrity charts go, the dot plot has to be up there. Check out how much &amp;ldquo;dot plot&amp;rdquo; has grown in search popularity since the Fed introduced their dot plot in 2012:
Ultimately, it will look something like this:
The dot plot is a special chart that shows the distribution of expectations of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) for the federal funds rate.</description>

      <description>A dataviz remix I came across some interesting analysis from Josh Lehner at the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis about the &amp;ldquo;Housing Trilemma&amp;rdquo;.
The Housing Trilemma, captured in the chart below is based on the following claim:
 Every city wants to have a strong local economy, high quality of life and housing affordability for its residents. Unfortunately these three dimensions represent the Housing Trilemma. A city can achieve success on two but not all three at the same time.</description>

Housing unit growth One key factor driving housing market dynamics is the expansion of housing supply (or lack thereof). The updated estimates from Census allow us to see which areas have added the most housing units and how that relates to population and house price trends.</description>

The big news was that the FOMC still considered a June rate hike a possibility. How much does Fed policy impact mortgage rates?

      <description>IntroductionTHIS POST CONSIDERS recent trends in house prices. Thinking a great deal about house prices, I like to look at many different DATA VISUALIZATIONS of house prices, at the national, state, and metro levels of aggregation. Also, in this post, I will include descriptions of how I built my visualizations, including code. These meditations as I call them, required some data wrangling and some thinking as to how to construct the charts.</description>

      <description>EARLIER THIS WEEK the Census Bureau released the latest Housing Vacancy Survey (HVS) data for the first quarter of 2016.
Much attention went to the homeownership rate estimates, which showed a decline in homeownership rates near a 48-year low. The gif below shows the history of the homeownership rate as estimated by the HVS.
And here&amp;rsquo;s a still image of the same data:

Jed Kolko published a nice summary of these data, and it got me thinking about the relationship of population growth rates and house prices. In this post I want to consider a few key things I found by exploring these data.

Trulia broke housing inventory into &amp;ldquo;starter homes&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;move-up homes&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;premium homes&amp;rdquo;. They found that the inventory of available homes for-sale has shifted towards premium homes and away from starter homes that first time homebuyers would typically be buying.</description>

National house prices rise 6.2% Freddie Mac released its full year 2015 house price index and an interactive data visualization. The seasonally-adjusted national index increased 6.2 percent year-over-year and is now 29.6 percent above the post-recession low, and just 4.1 percent below the (nominal) pre-recession peak (see graph below).
While national house price growth has been strong, there is considerable variation across the country. Some states and metro areas are already well above their pre-recession (nominal) peak, while other still have lots of ground to make up.</description>

      <description>Mid-week chart update THERE HAVE NOT been a lot of data releases this week, but that&amp;rsquo;s no excuse not to get busy charting. I tweeted  out several charts so far this week. Here&amp;rsquo;s a recap of my favorites for this half-week.
Are wages increasing&amp;hellip;or is it merely a trick of the light? We got this week&amp;rsquo;s charting started with some data from last week. The jobs report  came out last Friday (see our discussion from last week) .</description>

The week ahead Next week there are several data releases but the two that I‚Äôm paying especially close attention to are the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) and Housing Starts, part of the New Residential Construction joint release by Census and HUD.
Will builders maintain their sunny outlook? The HMI is a diffusion index based on survey questions about homebuilder‚Äôs attitudes. Values of the index above 50 indicate that on balance, more respondents feel positive than negative about the current conditions in and direction of the single-family housing market.</description>
