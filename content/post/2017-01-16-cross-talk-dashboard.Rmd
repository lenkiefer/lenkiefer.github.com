  IN THIS POST I SHARE WITH YOU SOMETHING I BUILT with R, a simple dashboard using [crosstalk]( http://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/), [plotly]( https://plot.ly/r/), and [data tables]( https://rstudio.github.io/DT/).  By using [htmlwidgets]( http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) we can create an interactive dashboard in a static webpage.

In this version I created a few line charts and data tables.  Then I created a linked view using crosstalk to enable you to filter the table and chart simultaneously.

Check out the [fullscreen version here.](../../../../chartbooks/jan2017/housing-market-dashboard-jan2017.html)

Source code is available on the upper left corner.
