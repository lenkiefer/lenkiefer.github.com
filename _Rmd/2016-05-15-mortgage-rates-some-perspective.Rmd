# Another mortgage rates animated gif

IN THE PAST I've told you [how I made my mortgage rates gif]({% post_url 2016-03-10-mortgage-rates-gif %}). In this post I'm make an extension that uses stop motion techniques to reverse course. We'll end up with this:

<img src="{{ site.url }}/img/charts_may_15_2016/rate_5_14_2016.gif" alt="stop motion rates gif"/>

For reference, here's the standard gif I share each Thursday after mortgage rates come out:

# Stop motion animation

While thinking about the week-to-week movements in rates it's easy to lose longer-term perspective.  Rates in the week of May 12, 2016 were the lowest in three years.  I decided to tweak my animation to give that perspective.

In order to do so I thought I'd first roll forward in time from the beginning of 2016 and then start rolling *backward* in time.  For the standard gif I fix the scales so that you aren't disoriented by movement. But when going backward in time I let the scales dynamically adjust so you can feel the range of data change. I also added some rough easing effects by changing the number of weeks between frames, speeding up and slowing down the animation as we move through time.

## The code

Here's the R script to enable the animation:

```{r , warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE,echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE }
#Load some data stored in a text file called "pmms30yr"
#these data have one column of dates, one column of rates, and helper columns called year and week (week number)
pmms30yr <- fread("pmms30yr.txt")
pmms30yr$date<-as.Date(pmms30yr$date, format="%m/%d/%Y")


# plot function to draw graph, takes data set as input
myplotf<-function (d){
  g<-
    ggplot(data=d, aes(x=date,y=rate,label=rate))+geom_line()+
    # My favorite minimal theme for gplot2
    theme_minimal()+
    # add red ball at end of time series
    geom_point(data=d[date==max(d$date)],size=2,color="red")+  
    # add open circle at 3.57 on May 12
    geom_point(data=d[date==as.Date("2016-05-12")],size=2,color="red",shape=1)+ 
    # add 3.57 in red text
    geom_text(data=d[date==as.Date("2016-05-12")],color="red",nudge_x=0.25,hjust=-0.2)+
    # add dotted red line at 3.57%, laste point
    geom_segment(xend=-Inf,x=as.numeric(as.Date("2016-05-12")),y=3.57,yend=3.57,color="red",linetype=2)+
    # set title size
    theme(plot.title=element_text(size=18))+
    # adjust caption, add breathing room
    theme(plot.caption=element_text(hjust=0,vjust=1,margin=margin(t=10)))+
    theme(plot.margin=unit(c(0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25),"cm"))
  return (g)
  }

# helper dataset with data since 2013, not necessary & vestigal from how I built this up
dd13<-pmms30yr[year>=2013]$date

# Note, I did some counting to figure out which weeks I needed for the animation.  Not elegant, but works.


#Run the animation

#Partition data: 2016 YTD, since May 2013, 5 years prior
oopt = ani.options(interval = 0.01)
saveGIF({
  #First standard forward animation (slowed to half place by pausing in J:
  for (i in 1:19) {
  for (j in 1:2){
    g<-myplotf(pmms30yr[year==2016 & week <=i])+
      #Add labels and caption, use subtitle for annotations
      labs(x="", y="",
         title="30-year Fixed Mortgage Rate (%)",
         subtitle="Mortgage rates decline throughout 2016 reaching a low on May 12...",

  ani.pause()}
}
  #Pause for drama
    for (i2 in 1:8) {
    print(g)
    ani.pause()
  }
  # Start moving backwards to three years ago:
  for (i in 1:137) {
    g<-
      myplotf(pmms30yr[date>= dd13[157-i]])+
      labs(x="", y="",
           title="30-year Fixed Mortgage Rate (%)",
           subtitle="...rates haven't been this low in three years...",
           caption="@lenkiefer Source: Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey")
      #annotate("text", x=pmms30yr[year==2016 & week==1]$date, y=3.5, 
               #label="...rates haven't been\n that low in\n three years.",color="red",hjust=0)
    print(g)
    ani.pause()
  }
  #Pause for more drama
  for (i2 in 1:8) {
    print(g)
    ani.pause()
  }
  #Start moving backwards:
  #   I want to move slowly (by six week increments) faster (13 week) faster (26 weeks)
  #   Then slow down (13 weeks) to (6 weeks) to finally 1 week
  for (i in c(seq(1,365,6),seq(378,716,13),seq(1145,1574,26),seq(1587,2003,13),seq(2016,2185,6),2196) ) {
    g<-
      myplotf(pmms30yr[date>= dd[2353-156-i]])+
      labs(x="", y="",
           title="30-year Fixed Mortgage Rate (%)",
           subtitle="...and rates are very low by historical standards",
           caption="@lenkiefer Source: Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey")
    print(g)
    ani.pause()
  }
  for (i2 in 1:8) {
    print(g)
    ani.pause()
  }
},movie.name="rate_5_14_2016.gif",ani.width = 575, ani.height = 450)

```

And the result:
